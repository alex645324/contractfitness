# **Debugging Checklist**

## 1. **Understand the Problem**

* Run the app and review **terminal logs**.
* Do not assume or guess.
* Add debug statements if needed.
* Keep digging and adding debug until you know exactly what is happening and why. 

---

## 2. **Identify the Cause**

* Use logs + debugs to pinpoint the exact line or logic causing the bug.
* Confirm it with evidence, not hunches.

---

## 3. **Simplify the Logic**

* Remove or reduce code that does not serve the goal functionality.
* Delete overcomplicated logic.
* Keep only the **simplest, most efficient version** that works.

---

## 4. **Respect Boundaries**

* Do not change logic outside the bug you are fixing.
* If a change outside the bug’s scope is required → **ask for approval first**.

---

## 5. **Apply Implementation Principles**

* Always follow the rules defined in **M.md**.
* Confirm before coding each step.
* Reuse existing logic where possible.

⚠️ **Golden Rule:**
Debugging = **Understand deeply → Identify cause → Simplify aggressively → Fix only what’s broken.**
